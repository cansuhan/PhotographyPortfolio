            <p>
                <br>
                I think the most interesting fact about me is my love for photography. Photography made me appreciate
                the
                simple
                experience of everyday life, fleeting beauty of in-between moments, and it has been a way of giving
                these
                back
                to the world. I initially started shooting digital photography but found myself wanting to experience
                the photographs more closely. When I was training as a field archaeologist in Cyprus, roaming around old
                town Nicosia, I found a basket of old film cameras in a second-hand bookshop. I was there looking at the
                cameras for a while and the owner came up to me, picked up a camera, and said back in the day this was
                his
                favourite to shoot with. We ended up talking for a while about photography and the beauty of simple
                moments
                that are often missed in the everyday bustle. Somehow, I was convinced I needed the camera he was
                selling,
                and thatâ€™s how I got into film photography. Shooting with film slows me down and makes me think more
                when
                collecting moments and developing the 35mm photographs myself has been an immersive experience.
